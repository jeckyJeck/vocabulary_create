{"word": "correlation", "main_definition": "Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two or more variables fluctuate together.", "meanings_and_examples": [{"definition": "A relationship between changes in two different things, where they increase or decrease together", "example": "There seems to be a strong correlation between ice cream sales and the number of drowning incidents. As ice cream sales go up during summer months, so do drowning incidents."}, {"definition": "A positive relationship where an increase in one variable is associated with an increase in another", "example": "There is a strong correlation between hours studied and test scores; students who study more tend to score higher on tests."}, {"definition": "A negative relationship where an increase in one variable corresponds to a decrease in the other", "example": "As temperature increases, ice cream sales also rise. However, there's a negative correlation between temperatures and heating costs as warmer weather means less need for heating."}, {"definition": "The degree to which two variables are associated or related", "example": "In economics, the correlation coefficient measures how strongly GDP growth and unemployment rates move together."}]}
