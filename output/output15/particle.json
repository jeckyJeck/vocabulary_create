{"word": "particle", "main_definition": "A particle is a small, localized object to which can be ascribed several physical or chemical properties such as volume or mass.", "meanings_and_examples": [{"definition": "In physics, a particle refers to an entity with physical existence that may possess attributes like mass and charge. It is often used in the context of subatomic particles, which are constituents of matter and energy at quantum levels.", "example": "Electrons and protons are examples of fundamental particles."}, {"definition": "In chemistry, a particle can refer to atoms or molecules. These are the smallest units of chemical elements or compounds that retain their characteristic properties during reactions.", "example": "A water molecule is made up of two hydrogen particles and one oxygen particle."}, {"definition": "In computer science, particularly in programming, a 'particle' can refer to an object or data structure used to represent some element of the program. It doesn't have a specific meaning but is used to encapsulate properties and behaviors.", "example": "A particle in graphics programming could be a point on a screen with associated color information."}, {"definition": "In meteorology, 'particle' refers to tiny solid or liquid droplets that are suspended in the atmosphere. These particles can affect weather patterns and air quality.", "example": "Airborne dust particles contribute to haze in urban areas."}, {"definition": "In particle physics, a 'particle' is an object with properties like charge, spin, and mass. This term often relates to the smallest known components of matter.", "example": "Quarks are fundamental particles that make up protons and neutrons."}]}
