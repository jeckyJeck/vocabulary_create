{"word": "vertex", "main_definition": "The point or tip of a geometric figure, especially the corners or points where two lines meet in geometry.", "meanings_and_examples": [{"definition": "In mathematics and geometry, it refers to a corner or a point where two line segments intersect. For example, the vertex of an angle is the point where its two sides meet.", "example": "The vertices of this triangle are at points A, B, and C."}, {"definition": "In geometry, it also refers to a corner or a tip of a polygon. For instance, a pentagon has five vertices, which are the five corners where sides meet.", "example": "The vertices of this hexagonal pattern can be found at each point where two lines intersect."}, {"definition": "In astronomy, it refers to a significant celestial event that occurs when two celestial bodies come closest together in the sky. For example, a lunar eclipse vertex is when Earth's shadow fully covers the Moon.", "example": "The vertices of this planetary alignment occur once every 18 years."}, {"definition": "In physics and engineering, it refers to the highest point or peak in an oscillation. For example, in a pendulum's swing, the vertex is where the pendulum changes direction.", "example": "The amplitude of the wave reached its maximum at the vertex."}, {"definition": "In electronics and signal processing, it refers to the peak point on a graph representing voltage or current. For example, in an oscilloscope reading, the vertices indicate points where the signal's value is highest.", "example": "The peaks of this sine wave are located at its vertices."}]}
