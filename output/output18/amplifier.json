{"word": "amplifier", "main_definition": "An amplifier is a device that increases the power or intensity of an electrical signal, often used in audio systems to enhance sound volume.", "meanings_and_examples": [{"definition": "In electronics, an amplifier is a device that takes in a small electrical signal and produces a larger version of it without distorting the original content.", "example": "When you connect your phone to a speaker system using an audio cable, the built-in amplifier within the speaker boosts the sound volume."}, {"definition": "In communication systems, an amplifier is used to increase the strength of a signal that has been transmitted over long distances.", "example": "Telephone signals are often sent through cables and may require amplifiers at intervals to maintain their quality as they travel."}, {"definition": "In the context of figurative language, an 'amplifier' refers to a word or phrase that increases the impact or emphasis of another element in speech or writing.", "example": "The word 'completely,' when used before 'destroyed,' acts as an amplifier to intensify the meaning."}, {"definition": "In physics, a mechanical amplifier is a device that multiplies force. A common example of this type includes levers.", "example": "A crowbar can be used as a mechanical amplifier; applying a small amount of effort at one end results in a larger force being exerted at the other end."}]}
