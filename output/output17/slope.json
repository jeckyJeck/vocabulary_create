{"word": "slope", "main_definition": "In mathematics, the slope of a line is its steepness or incline measured as the ratio of the rise (vertical change) to the run (horizontal change). In other contexts, it can refer to an inclined surface or gradual increase/decrease.", "meanings_and_examples": [{"definition": "Mathematical concept describing the steepness of a line", "example": "The slope of a straight line is constant, while the slope of a curve changes at every point."}, {"definition": "Gradient or incline in geometry and physics", "example": "A ski run has a steep slope that challenges even experienced skiers."}, {"definition": "Rate of change in various fields like economics, where it may describe the rate at which something grows or shrinks over time", "example": "The company's revenue is increasing at a steady slope, indicating consistent growth."}]}
