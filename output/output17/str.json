{"word": "str", "main_definition": "The word 'str' is not an idiom but seems to be a shorthand or typo, possibly meant as 'string'. In programming contexts, it refers to a sequence of characters. However, since it doesn't directly correspond to an established English idiom, I will provide meanings related to the concept of strings in computer science and examples.", "meanings_and_examples": [{"definition": "A string is a data type used in programming that represents a sequence of characters. It can include letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces.", "example": "In Python, 'Hello, World!' is an example of a string."}, {"definition": "String concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings end-to-end to create a new string in programming languages like C++, Java, and JavaScript.", "example": "In JavaScript, 'Hello' + ' ' + 'World!' results in the string 'Hello World!'."}, {"definition": "String manipulation involves modifying or extracting information from strings. This can include operations such as trimming whitespace, replacing characters, and splitting a string into substrings.", "example": "In Python, using the strip() method removes leading and trailing whitespace: '  hello world! '.strip() returns 'hello world!'."}, {"definition": "A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a larger string. Substring operations include finding all occurrences of a specific character or sequence, slicing to extract parts of the string, and replacing substrings.", "example": "In Java, 'HelloWorld'.replace('World', 'Universe') replaces 'World' with 'Universe' in the string."}]}
