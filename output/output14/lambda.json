{"word": "lambda", "main_definition": "Lambda is a term used in various fields such as mathematics, physics, computer science, and programming languages with specific meanings related to functions or variables.", "meanings_and_examples": [{"definition": "In mathematics and logic, lambda represents an anonymous function or procedure without a name. It's used in the lambda calculus, which forms the basis for functional programming languages like Python, Lisp, Haskell etc.", "example": "The expression (lambda x: x * 2) is a simple example of a lambda function that takes one argument and returns its double."}, {"definition": "In physics, lambda is the symbol for wavelength - the spatial period of a wave or oscillation. It's used to describe the properties of waves such as light, sound, or radio.", "example": "The red color we see in an object comes from the specific wavelengths (lambda) that are being reflected."}, {"definition": "In computer science and programming, lambda is used to denote anonymous functions. It's commonly seen in functional programming languages or with certain APIs like Python's map(), filter() functions etc.", "example": "The following code uses a lambda function within the Python built-in map() function: list(map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3]))"}, {"definition": "In engineering and physics, Lambda (\u03bb) is used to represent the decay constant in radioactive decay.", "example": "The half-life of a substance can be calculated using its decay constant, denoted by lambda."}]}
