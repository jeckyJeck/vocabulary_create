It consists of two numbers: the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is the top number that indicates how many parts are being considered, while the denominator (below the line) shows into how many equal parts the whole is divided.", "example": "In the fraction 3/4, '3' is the numerator representing three parts out of four equal parts."}, {"definition": "As an idiomatic expression, 'fraction' can refer to a small part or portion of something when it does not make up an entirety. It often implies that whatever is being discussed is only a minor segment of the whole.", "example": "'The success of this project is just one fraction of our overall goals.'"}, {"definition": "'Fraction' in everyday language might also refer to an unspecified or ambiguous part, especially when discussing issues like fairness, allocation, or distribution where the exact portion is not clearly defined.", "example": "'The teacher said that grading would be done fairly but didn't explain how. It seemed more of a fraction of consideration than full justice.'"}, {"definition": "'Fraction' can also imply a minority or lesser group within a larger community, organization, or population.", "example": "'The new policy was passed with the support of just one-fifth of the committee, making it a small fraction of the members.'"}]}
