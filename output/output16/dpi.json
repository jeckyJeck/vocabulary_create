{"word": "dpi", "main_definition": "DPI stands for dots per inch, a measure of spatial printing or video dot density.", "meanings_and_examples": [{"definition": "A measurement unit used to describe the resolution of an image or printed material by counting how many pixels or dots exist within one linear inch. It determines print quality and detail level.", "example": "A 300 DPI printer can produce a high-quality photo where each inch contains approximately 300 individual dots."}, {"definition": "In digital imaging, it refers to the number of pixels per inch in an image file. More pixels result in higher quality and detail.", "example": "A photograph with a resolution of 2400 DPI will have a lot more detail than one at 72 DPI."}, {"definition": "In the context of digital screens, such as monitors or television displays, it indicates how many pixels are displayed per inch. Higher DPI values mean higher pixel density and sharper images.", "example": "A 4K monitor has a resolution of approximately 854 x 480 DPI."}, {"definition": "In web design, it's used to describe the print-ready state of digital designs. The higher the DPI, the more detail and sharpness when printed.", "example": "Before printing a webpage layout on paper, the designer may increase its DPI from 72 to 300 for better quality."}]}
