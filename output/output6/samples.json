{"word": "samples", "main_definition": "Samples refer to instances or pieces of something, often used in various contexts such as research, quality control, music production, and more.", "meanings_and_examples": [{"definition": "In the context of research or experiments, a sample refers to a subset of individuals from a larger population that is being studied. This allows researchers to make inferences about the whole group based on this smaller set. Example: A medical study might use samples of patients to test the effectiveness of a new drug.", "example": "The scientists collected blood samples from 100 volunteers to analyze for signs of the disease."}, {"definition": "In quality control and manufacturing, a sample is an individual unit or small portion taken from a larger batch to check for consistency and adherence to standards. Example: A factory inspects random samples of smartphones every day to ensure they meet the required specifications.", "example": "The technician checked the quality by testing five different samples of steel."}, {"definition": "In music production, a sample refers to an audio clip or snippet that is taken from one sound recording and reused in another. Example: A hip-hop artist may use drum loops as samples to create new beats for their songs.", "example": "The producer used an old jazz tune as a sample for the chorus of her track."}, {"definition": "In statistics, a sample refers to a set of observations or measurements taken from a population. This subset is analyzed to make conclusions about the entire group. Example: A pollster surveys 100 people in a city (the sample) and uses that data to predict voting patterns for an upcoming election.", "example": "The survey included interviews with 200 residents as a sample to understand their opinions on local education."}, {"definition": "In computer science, particularly in programming or algorithms, a sample may refer to a small data set used for testing purposes. Example: A programmer uses an array of numbers as a sample input to verify the functionality of his sorting algorithm.", "example": "The developer tested her new function with a sample of 50 randomly generated numbers."}]}
