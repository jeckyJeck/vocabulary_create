{"word": "receptor", "main_definition": "A receptor is a protein molecule that receives chemical signals from outside a cell, which then triggers some process within the cell. It can also refer to structures or devices designed to receive specific inputs.", "meanings_and_examples": [{"definition": "In biology, a receptor is a protein molecule that binds to a specific substance (ligand) and triggers some process within the cell. For example: 'The insulin receptors on the surface of muscle cells help regulate blood sugar levels.'", "example": "Insulin Receptor"}, {"definition": "A receptor in pharmacology is a protein molecule that drugs or other substances bind to, resulting in a biological effect. For example: 'The opioid receptors are the target of many pain-relief medications.'", "example": "Opioid Receptor"}, {"definition": "A communication receiver or antenna is a device that receives electromagnetic signals, such as radio waves. For example: 'The satellite dish on the roof acts as an aerial receptor for television broadcasts.'", "example": "Satellite Dish"}, {"definition": "In electronics, a receiver is a device that receives and processes signals from various sources.
