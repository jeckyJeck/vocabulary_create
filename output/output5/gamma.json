{"word": "gamma", "main_definition": "Gamma is an alpha-numeric symbol representing a concept in physics, mathematics, or idiomatic expressions.", "meanings_and_examples": [{"definition": "In nuclear physics, Gamma refers to high-energy electromagnetic radiation emitted from the nucleus of an atom during radioactive decay.", "example": "Gamma rays can penetrate through many types of materials and require protective measures."}, {"definition": "In mathematics, particularly calculus, Gamma is a function that extends factorial to non-integer values. It's commonly used in various formulas.", "example": "The gamma function (\u0393(n)) is the integral of x^(n-1)e^(-x)dx from 0 to infinity."}, {"definition": "In finance, Gamma refers to an option strategy known as 'Gamma Neutral' which aims to minimize the risk related to changes in the underlying asset's price.", "example": "A trader creates a gamma neutral position by adjusting the quantities of long and short options positions."}, {"definition": "In computer science, specifically in programming languages like Python, Gamma is sometimes used to represent variables or functions. For example, 'g' could be a function that calculates the factorial using the gamma function.", "example": "def g(x): return math.gamma(x+1)"}, {"definition": "In physics and engineering, Gamma is used to describe certain characteristics of materials or phenomena. For instance, it can refer to thermal conductivity in a specific context.", "example": "The gamma rays emitted by the material indicated its high-energy state."}]}
